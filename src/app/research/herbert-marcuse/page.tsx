                    Who Was Herbert Marcuse?
                  </h2>
                  <p className="mt-4">
                    Herbert Marcuse (1898–1979) was a German-American philosopher, sociologist, and political theorist. 
                    He was a leading figure in the Frankfurt School, a group of neo-Marxist intellectuals who sought to 
                    apply Marxist theory beyond just economics, expanding it into culture, psychology, and social structures.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-4">
                    Marcuse's work laid the foundation for what is now called "Cultural Marxism," an idea that economic 
                    class struggle should be replaced with identity-based struggles (race, gender, sexuality, etc.) as a 
                    means of dismantling Western society.

                    <p className="mt-2">
                      Marcuse argued that true tolerance requires the suppression of conservative, traditional, and 
                      right-wing ideas while promoting leftist, progressive, and radical ideas. In his essay 
                      <em> Repressive Tolerance</em>, he wrote that:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-highlight pl-4 italic my-4">
                      "Liberating tolerance would mean intolerance against movements from the Right and toleration 
                      of movements from the Left."
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                      This idea justified censorship and suppression of opposing viewpoints, something that has now 
                      manifested in modern cancel culture, media bias, and academic gatekeeping.

                      <li>
                        Marcuse rejected traditional economic Marxism (which focuses on class struggle) and instead 
                        shifted Marxism into the realm of culture.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        He believed that Western culture itself was oppressive and needed to be dismantled.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        This led to the "Long March Through the Institutions," where Marxists would infiltrate academia, 
                        media, government, and cultural institutions to reshape Western values from within.
                      </li>

                      <li>
                        Marcuse promoted the idea that racial minorities, feminists, and sexual minorities should be 
                        the new "revolutionary class," replacing the working-class that Marx originally envisioned.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        This is why modern leftist activism focuses on race, gender, and identity politics rather than 
                        traditional economic class struggle.
