              Who Was Herbert Marcuse?
            </h2>
            <p className="mt-4">
              Herbert Marcuse (1898â€“1979) was a German-American philosopher, sociologist, and political theorist. 
              He was a leading figure in the Frankfurt School, a group of neo-Marxist intellectuals who sought to 
              apply Marxist theory beyond just economics, expanding it into culture, psychology, and social structures.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              Marcuse's work laid the foundation for what is now called "Cultural Marxism," an idea that economic 
              class struggle should be replaced with identity-based struggles (race, gender, sexuality, etc.) as a 
              means of dismantling Western society.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">1. Repressive Tolerance (1965)</h3>
              <p className="mt-2">
                Marcuse argued that true tolerance requires the suppression of conservative, traditional, and 
                right-wing ideas while promoting leftist, progressive, and radical ideas. In his essay 
                <em> Repressive Tolerance</em>, he wrote that:
              </p>
              <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-highlight pl-4 italic my-4">
                "Liberating tolerance would mean intolerance against movements from the Right and toleration 
                of movements from the Left."
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                This idea justified censorship and suppression of opposing viewpoints, something that has now 
                manifested in modern cancel culture, media bias, and academic gatekeeping.

              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-2">
                <li>
                  Marcuse rejected traditional economic Marxism (which focuses on class struggle) and instead 
                  shifted Marxism into the realm of culture.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He believed that Western culture itself was oppressive and needed to be dismantled.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This led to the "Long March Through the Institutions," where Marxists would infiltrate academia, 
                  media, government, and cultural institutions to reshape Western values from within.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-2">
                <li>
                  Marcuse promoted the idea that racial minorities, feminists, and sexual minorities should be 
                  the new "revolutionary class," replacing the working-class that Marx originally envisioned.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This is why modern leftist activism focuses on race, gender, and identity politics rather than 
                  traditional economic class struggle.

                  He was highly critical of capitalism and believed personal liberation was tied to overthrowing

                <li>
                  His book <em>Eros and Civilization</em> (1955) pushed for sexual liberation and the destruction

              Conclusion: Marcuse's Lasting Impact
            </h2>
            <p className="mt-4">
              Marcuse's Cultural Marxism has led to the modern "Woke Revolution," where identity replaces class 
              as the core of political struggle. His theories transformed Marxism from an economic ideology into 
              a cultural movement, influencing social justice activism, cancel culture, and institutional censorship.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 font-medium">
              While traditional economic Marxism failed in the West, Marcuse's cultural Marxism succeeded, 
              reshaping institutions from within.
